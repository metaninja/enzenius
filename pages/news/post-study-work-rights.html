      <h2>
        Post-Study Work Rights For International Students Changes
      </h2>
      <p>Wednesday, August 8, 2018</p>

      <p>
        Following a public consultation, the New Zealand Government has come up with
        <strong>
          <a
              href="https://www.immigration.govt.nz/about-us/media-centre/news-notifications/changes-to-post-study-work-rights-for-international-students"
              target="_blank">
            changes to immigration settings</a>
        </strong>
          that impact post-study work rights for international students.
      </p>

      <p>
        The changes are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          To remove the employer-assisted post-study work visas at all levels
        </li>
        <li>
          To provide a one-year post-study open work visa for students studying Level 4 – 6 and non-degree Level 7
          qualifications, with an additional year for Graduate Diploma graduates who are working towards registration
          with a professional or trade body
        </li>
        <li>
          To provide a two-year post-study open work visa for students studying Level 4 – 6 and non-degree Level 7
          qualifications outside Auckland, provided study is completed by December 2021, at which point the entitlement
          for post-study work rights reverts to a one-year post-study open work visa for students studying Level 4 – 6
          and non-degree Level 7 qualifications with an additional year for Graduate Diploma graduates who are working
          towards registration with a professional or trade body
        </li>
        <li>
          To provide a three-year post-study open work visa for degree Level 7 or above qualifications
        </li>
        <li>
          To require international students studying Level 8 qualifications to be in an area specified on the Long Term
          Skills Shortage list, in order for their partner to be eligible for an open work visa, and in turn the
          partners’  dependent children to be eligible for fee-free domestic schooling
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These changes come into effect on 26 November 2018.
      </p>

      <p>
        They are intended to support the attraction of international students studying at higher levels and preserve
        a  pathway to residence for those with the skills and qualifications New Zealand needs, specifically through
        the link between more generous post-study work rights to higher level qualifications.
      </p>

      <p>
        There has been significant growth in the international education sector over the last few years, especially
        in  below degree level qualifications. As a result, there has been a decline in the skill level of people
        moving through the immigration system and granted permanent residency.
      </p>

      <p>
        We want to ensure that post-study pathways for international students are fit-for-purpose and contribute the
        skills and qualifications New Zealand needs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Government wants to support the transition to these new immigration settings. These changes include a
        three year, time-limited incentive for international students to study outside Auckland. This is to ensure
        the  benefits of international education are shared throughout all the regions of New Zealand, supporting the
        Government’s aims to lift regional investment, growth and productivity.
