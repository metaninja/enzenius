              The history of New Zealand is quite varied. As mentioned above, there were no humans on the islands
              until  at least 1250 AD. It is thought to be one of the last major land areas that humans arrived to.
              The  first population was from Polynesian settlers, which had arrived through a number of travels
              across  the Pacific Ocean. They developed a culture that is called the Māori. The Māori, like most
              indigenous people, had tribes and subtribes that lived throughout the islands; they would work together
              on certain tasks, but there was also infighting between the tribes.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 1642, a Dutch explorer named Abel Tasman arrived to New Zealand, bringing potatoes and muskets with
              him. As more Europeans brought these items, there started to be a lot of discomfort between the tribes
              of  the Māori. The culmination was the Musket Wars, where over three thousand battles were fought
              throughout New Zealand between the tribes. Shortly after, in 1840, the Treaty of Waitangi was signed;
              this resulted in New Zealand coming under the British crown as a British colony.

              The reason that many people enjoy going to New Zealand is because of its biodiversity. There are a
              number  of plants, animals, and fungi that reside throughout the country, mainly because of the fact
              that  there were no humans on the island until 1250 AD. The Europeans did not even arrive until 1642,
              well  after the Americas and other countries were discovered by them. This isolation allowed nature to
              thrive much longer than it did on other continents where there was more human influence.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are literally hundreds of animals that you can find throughout New Zealand that you cannot find
              anywhere else in the world, especially in terms of birds and marine life (mammals, fish). The only
              mammals that are native to the country are bats; other animals that you find were brought into the
              country when people came in and immigrated into the area. The country actually has a number of laws and
              regulations in place in order to keep the animals in and around the country safe from poaching and
              other  illegal activities. You can find more information about this from the Department of Conservation
              website.

              Even though the country went under the authority of the crown of the United Kingdom in 1853, the
              country  has governed itself since 1853. The Queen of England is still the head of state, with a
              representative known as the Governor-General representing her in the country, but the government is
              parliamentary. The Governor-General, at this point, is only a formal role unless the government is
              having  issues or is upheaval; then he or she has the right to step in and make decisions.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Prime Minister is not voted in through a traditional vote, rather, he or she is chosen because they
              are the leader of the party that controls most of the Parliament after a general election. This doesn’t
              always happen, there are a couple of cases that the Prime Minister has been another member of the
              majority  party, but it is usually how it works. The Governor-General can dismiss the Prime Minister is
              there is something wrong in the system. The Prime Minister has a Cabinet that he or she sets up after
              the  election has completed, and that is the executive part of the government.

              New Zealand has a largely temperate climate. While the far north has subtropical weather During summer,
              and inland alpine areas of the South Island can be as cold as -10 C in winter, most of the country lies
              close to the coast, which means mild temperatures, moderate rainfall, and abundant sunshine.

              of multi-ethnic migration which followed the British colonization of New Zealand.

              New Zealand, although it is the same size as Japan or Great Britain, but there are a lot of reasons
              that  you should consider going there for your studies abroad. Many people will call natives of the
              country “Kiwis,” after the bird that only resides there and nowhere else in the entire world. There are
              a  number of reasons that you should consider studying in New Zealand instead of considering other
              countries; that’s what we’re going to look at in this section of our website.

              Kiwis are some of the most amazing, loving, and welcoming people that you will ever meet. If you are a
              stranger, a native New Zealander is going to treat you like you are a friend. They are used to meeting
              new people, first because they travel a lot themselves, and also because a lot of people come to visit
              New Zealand as well. The culture on the islands is quite laid back and easy going, as well. So you’re
              not  going to feel tense like you would if you went to a large city like London or New York City to
              study. There are just over 4 million people who reside on the country, and it is one of the safest
              places  to live in the world. Another cool thing about the people is that there are so many different
              kinds of people. For being such a small country, the diversity is greater than you see in many European
              countries.

              Some people say that, because the country is in a small corner of the world that doesn’t really get
              bothered by anyone that New Zealand seems to be secluded from the rest of the world. This isn’t true at
              all. As mentioned above, the people are really welcoming to outsiders. But, it can also be a great
              thing!  The economy is actually incredibly stable, the cost of living is low, and the government is
              more  stable (and less argumentative) than the governments that you will see in other countries. This
              is  probably the reason that immigration is embraced, which we will talk about more in some of our
              later  points.

              Nothing can get better than the weather in New Zealand. The winters are mild, with temperatures around
              10ºC (50ºF) and slightly wet. In higher altitudes, you will see snow, but it’s not common in lower
              altitudes. In the summers, the climate is warm and dry with temperatures around 25ºC (77ºF). As you
              would  expect in the southern hemisphere, the summer lasts from December to February; winter lasts from
              June to August. Spring and fall are similar, with cooler temperatures and little rain.

              This is the number one reason to go anywhere for school, but New Zealand is amazing for their
              educational  system. First, the tuition is some of the lowest in the world. You get a British-based
              education (due to their British influences) for a fraction of the cost. The degrees are recognized
              around  the world as being up-to-date and practical. You will get a high quality, hands on education
              that  you deserve. The New Zealand even goes so far as to checking each and every course, program, and
              certificate for quality so that they can be recognized around the world as high-quality education. Not
              only that, but the support services for international students are among the best in the world. They
              have  a lot of expertise and experience in helping international students so that they can succeed in
              their programs.
            </p>

            <p>
              New Zealand’s higher education system is internationally ranked. All eight of New Zealand’s
              universities  feature in the top three percent in the world, according to the 2016 QS World University
              Rankings. We’re the only country in the world to have all of our universities in the global top 500.

            <p>
              New Zealand is a member of the Lisbon Recognition Convention, which means our certificates, diplomas
              and  degrees are recognized in 50 participating countries. These include the United States, the  United
              Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Australia. Bachelor degrees are widely recognized on the job market
              by employers, and for enrolment in postgraduate programs.

            <p>
              Employers around the world welcome graduates of our education system because of their strong academic

              There are plenty of work opportunities available for international students. On a student visa, you are
              allowed to work up to 20 hours a week through the semester; During vacations you can work up to 40
              hours.  So, instead of having to worry about finances, you get to supplement your education with
              income.  You may even be able to nab internships and other practical work. The international studies
              office at your university can help you find a job to sustain you During your time in New Zealand.
              Another  great thing is that you can get a permit at the end of your degree program and work for up to
              3  years, depending on your coursework and degree program. No other countries in the world provide such

              The visa acquisition process is incredibly simple, and unlike many other countries, you will not be
              rejected right away. You get to talk to people and tell them your side of the story if there is
              something  that may prevent you from getting a visa to come into the country. If you can explain why
              you’ve decided to go down there and your international studies program helps you to create a Statement
              of  Purpose (a statement you give to the visa officer to tell them why you are coming to New Zealand to
              study), you will usually get a visa. The country is welcome to immigration, more so than almost any
              other  country in the world. The last advantage is that, after you graduate, as mentioned above, you
              can  work in the country for up to three (3) years. If the job you are working at is related to the
              degree that you received, you can actually apply to get permanent residency, which you will most likely
              get within 6 months of your application. We look at visa acquisition and residency more in our Visa and
              Passport section.
