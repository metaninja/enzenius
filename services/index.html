              The International English Language Testing System, or IELTS&trade; (/ˈaɪ.ɛlts/) is
              an international standardized test of English language proficiency for non-native
              English language speakers. IELTS is accepted by most Australian, British, Canadian,
              Irish and New Zealand academic institutions,
              by over 3,000 academic institutions in the Unitsed States, and by various
              professional organizations across the world.
            </p>

            <p>
              No minimum score is required to pass the test. An IELTS result or Test Report
              Form is isssued to all test takers with a score from &quot;band 1&quot; (&quot;non-user&quot;) to &quot;band
              9&quot; (&quot;expert user&quot;) and each institution sets a different threshold. There is also a
              &quot;band 0&quot; score for those who did not attempt the test. Institutions are advised not
              to consider a report older than two years to be valid, unless the user proves that
              they have worked to maintain their level.
